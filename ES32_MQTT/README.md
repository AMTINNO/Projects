# ESP32 MQTT – Publish and Subscribe with Arduino IDE
This project shows how to use MQTT communication protocol with the ESP32 to publish messages and subscribe to topics. As an example, we’ll publish BME280 sensor readings to the Node-RED Dashboard, and control an ESP32 output. The ESP32 we’ll be programmed using Arduino IDE.
